# Practical-Machine-Learning
This project goal is to predict the manner in which a group of enthusiasts, who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks, carried out the exercises. The data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants will be used for prediction. The "classe" variable in the training set is used as outcome for the prediction and the other variables were used to predict. This report describes how different models was built, how the testing set derived from the training set was used to confirm the accuracy of each model. The report also shows the expected out of sample error, and why the choices made, were made. Finally, the prediction model with the highest accuracy would used to predict 20 different test cases from the validation set.
